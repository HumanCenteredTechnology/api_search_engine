One of the main aspects in these systems is production planning, in particular scheduling operations on machines. We introduce here a new decision-making schema, Smart Scheduling, intended to yield flexible and efficient production schedules on the fly, taking advantage of the features of these new environments. The ability to face unforeseen and disruptive events is one of the main improvements in our proposed schema, which uses an efficient screening procedure (Tolerance Scheduling) to lessen the need of rescheduling in the face of those events."

This application is characterized by very high dimensions, with hundreds of features, and tens of thousands of cases. The efforts were directed toward a search for knowledge that would assist the engineers in providing another increment of performance to the already highly performing knowledge-based system. Two principal issues are addressed. The issues are whether a very expensive testing process can be eliminated while still maintaining high quality throughput in disk drive manufacturing, and whether the manufacturing process can be made more efficient by identifying bad disk drives prior to the expensive testing. Preliminary results indicate that although the expensive testing cannot be completely eliminated, a fraction of the disk drives can be determined to be faulty prior to further testing. This detection may improve the throughput of the manufacturing line."

In many cases engineers and physicists develop simulation tools, machine interfaces, and data exploration tools but lack essential training in Human-Computer Interaction. Without proper training the interaction of visual, cognitive and task complexity can lead to solutions that are valuable only to the developers themselves, but are not usable without extensive training. We show the most critical ergonomic factors for developing software in a scientific engineering setting that focuses on complex problems. We present an overview of usability methods as well as complexity reduction methods and their applicability in engineering software design. We present an exemplary study for the case of supply chain management, where the approaches were successfully integrated into a serious game not only serving as an investigatory tool but also as a training utility for supply chain managers. Practitioner Summary: This overview aims to be used as an entry point for engineers interested in usability and its applicability from a simulations and visualizations point of view. Factors that create complexity and how they can be reduced are presented. Usability methods are evaluated in regard to their applicability."

Organizations have business processes to manufacture products, provide services, purchase goods, handle applications, etc. Also in our daily lives we are involved in a variety of processes, for example when we use our car or when we book a trip via the Internet. Although such operational processes are omnipresent, they are at the same time intangible. Unlike a product or a piece of data, processes are less concrete because of their dynamic nature. However, more and more information about these processes is captured in the form of event logs. Contemporary systems ranging from copiers and medical devices to enterprise information systems and cloud infrastructures record events. These events can be used to make processes visible. Using process mining techniques it is possible to discover processes. This provides the insights necessary to manage, control, and improve processes. Process mining has been successfully applied in a variety of domains ranging from healthcare and e-business to high-tech systems and auditing. Despite these successes, there are still many challenges as process discovery shows that the real processes are more ""spaghetti-like"" than people like to think. It is still very difficult to capture the complex reality in a suitable model. Given the nature of these challenges, techniques originating from Computational Intelligence may assist in the discovery of complex processes."

With a strong connection to material handling equipment and automation solutions, intralogistics has proved to be one of the main factors responsible for something that is already happening: a fourth industrial revolution where it is possible to convert warehouses and manufacturing units into smart environments where the entire process can be controlled and supervised through a single system. It became necessary to develop more innovative and efficient solutions to the constant diversity of challenges proposed by the market. In this sense, it was proposed to develop something innovative within the area of Automated Storage and Retrieval Systems (AS/RS), a technology increasingly sought after by today‚Äôs manufacturing plants. As such, the goal was to improve the most emergent AS/RS in recent years: the Pallet/Box Shuttle AS/RS. In order to achieve the proposed objective, it was necessary to analyze all the existing solutions in the market and, mainly, to find the main systems to be improved and the direction to follow in order to create a novel solution based on the existing advanced solutions. Moreover, regarding the recent needs required by the smart factories and Industry 4.0, it was intended that the new system would be able to make an optimized selection of products, forming sets or sub-sets of different products picking them from different places of the rack, a situation that is quite frequent in companies that produce and assemble equipment. The solution obtained shows that it is possible to increase the automation of the operations in the storage systems and improve the responsiveness of the system, taking this solution to a new level. Different products can be picked-up and put in a same box, providing a set of products/components able to be used in a production line or to be provided to a customer."

Because FMEA has an object-oriented approach that‚Äôs very easy monitoring, development, use and modifies the software. Approach to solving such a complex system such as the production of cigarettes, here and abroad, have been analyzed in this way. A new approach is the analysis model and application of new tools for the analysis and synthesis model is an original scientific contribution. Because we have quality in all areas of production then we need to constant monitoring of the same. No human auditors, medals quality standards are not sufficient to at all times maintain the required level of product quality. We require adaptive expert systems for predictive control of industrial processes to be able to keep the process under constant control. This may not be the production of cigarettes, but the production of drinking water or other products. Even if the product is awarded the highest score, just one mistake can cause a bad product or a product which endangers human health. "
44,Smart manufacturing based on cyber-physical systems and beyond,https://www.researchgate.net/publication/322112340_Smart_manufacturing_based_on_cyber-physical_systems_and_beyond, Journal , Journal of Intelligent Manufacturing  ," Xifan Yao , Jiajun Zhou , Yingzi Lin , Yun Li ", 10.1007/s10845-017-1384-5 , 12/2019 ," Cyber-physical systems (CPS) have gained an increasing attention recently for their immense potential towards the next generation smart systems that integrate cyber technology into the physical processes. However, CPS did not initiate either smart factories or smart manufacturing, and vice versa. Historically, the smart factory was initially studied with the introduction of the Internet of Things (IoT) in manufacturing, and later became a key part of Industry 4.0. Also emerging are other related models such as cloud manufacturing, social manufacturing and proactive manufacturing with the introduction of cloud computing (broadly, the Internet of Services, IoS), social networking (broadly, the Internet of People, IoP) and big data (broadly, the Internet of Content and Knowledge, IoCK), respectively. At present, there is a lack of a systemic and comprehensive study on the linkages and relations between these terms. Therefore, this study first presents a comprehensive survey and analysis of the CPS treated as a combination of the IoT and the IoS. Then, the paper addresses CPS-based smart manufacturing as an eight tuple of CPS,IoT, IoS and IoCK as elements. Further, the paper extends the eight-tuple CPS-based manufacturing to social-CPS (SCPS)-based manufacturing, termed wisdom manufacturing, which forms a nine tuple with the addition of one more element, the IoP and which is based on the SCPS instead of CPS. Both architectures and characteristics for smart and wisdom manufacturing are addressed. As such, these terms‚Äô linkages are established and relations are clarified with a special discussion. This study thus contributes as a theoretical basis and as a comprehensive framework for emerging manufacturing integration."

Putting the operators in the centre of this new paradigm is mandatory for its success. The operators need to be empowered by giving them new tools and solutions for improving their decision-making processes.

Motor products from Solen Electric Company's motor production lines were used to predict failure points based on big data analytics, where 3606 datapoints from the company's testing equipment were statistically analyzed. The current study focused on secondary data and expert interview results to further define the relevant statistical dimensions. Only 14 of the original 88 detection parameters were required for monitoring the production line. The relationships between these parameters and the relevant motor components were established to indicate how an abnormal reading may be interpreted to quickly resolve an issue. Thus, a theoretical model for the monitoring of the motor production line was proposed. Further implications and practical suggestions are also offered to improve the production lines. This study explores big data analysis and smart manufacturing and demonstrates the promise of these technologies in improving production line efficiency and reducing waste to promote sustainable production goals. Big data thus constitute the core technology for advancing production lines into Industry 4.0 and promoting industry sustainability. ¬© 2020 by the authors."

A/D/RML consists of a six-work station (WS) mechatronics line (ML) connected to a flexible cell (FC) equipped with a six-degree of freedom (DOF) industrial robotic manipulator (IRM). The CAS has in its structure two driving wheels and one free wheel (2 DW/1 FW)-wheeled mobile robot (WMR) equipped with a 7-DOF robotic manipulator (RM). On the end effector of the RM, a mobile visual servoing system (eye-in-hand VSS) is mounted. The multifunctionality is provided by the three actions, assembly, disassembly, and repair, while the flexibility is due to the assembly of different products. After disassembly or repair, CAS picks up the disassembled components and transports them to the appropriate storage depots for reuse. Technology operates synchronously with signals from sensors and eye-in-hand VSS. Disassembling or repairing starts after assembling and the final assembled product fails the quality test.

Manufacturing companies, in which the human labour has a crucial role, need instruments able to manage complex production systems in terms of resource utilization, product mix, component allocation and material handling optimization. In this context, this work presents an original hardware/software architecture, Motion Analysis System (MAS), aimed at the human body digitalization and analysis during the execution of manufacturing/assembly tasks within the common industrial workstation. MAS is based on the integration of the Motion Capture (MOCAP) technology with an ad hoc software developed for productive and ergonomic analysis of the operator during his work. MAS hardware integrates a network of depth cameras initially developed for gaming (Microsoft Kinect v2‚Ñ¢, conceived for markerless MOCAP) and now used for industrial analysis, while an original software infrastructure is programmed to automatically and quantitatively provide productive information (human task analysis in terms of time execution and used space within the workplace, movements of hands and locations visited by the operator) and ergonomic information (full body analysis implementing all the internationally adopted indexes OWAS, REBA, NIOSH and EAWS). This double perspective makes MAS a unique and valuable tool for industrial managers oriented to the workplace analysis and design (in terms of productivity) without neglecting the operator health. This proposed contribution ends with a real industrial application analysing a water pump assembly station: the system setup is discussed and the key results obtained adopting MAS are presented and analysed. ¬© 2018"

However, this transition involves adopting technologically advanced machinery with a high level of digitization and communication. The costs and time to replace obsolete machines could be unsustainable for many companies while retrofitting the old machinery. To make them ready to the Industry 4.0 context, they may represent an alternative to the replacement. Even if there are many studies related to retrofitting applied to machinery, there are very few studies related to the literature process industry sector. In this work, we propose a case study of a two-phase mixing plant that needed to be enhanced in the safety and maintainability conditions with reasonable times and costs.

In the paper, detailed evaluation of machine learning based prediction methods was performed, including artificial neural networks (ANN), adaptive neuro fuzzy inference systems (AFNIS) and gradient boosted decision trees to optimize the process parameters of pin-in-paste. The methods were presented for predicting the hole-filling of solder paste during stencil printing and to enable an evaluation of the aforementioned methods for the specific problem. Experiments were performed to obtain the required input data (hole-filling against the process parameters) for the training of the prediction tools. A testboard with plated through-holes of different diameters (0.8, 1, 1.1, 1.4 mm) was applied. Type 4 lead-free solder paste (particle size 20‚Äì38 ¬µm) was deposited with stencil printing into the through-holes with different printing speeds (between 20 mm/s and 70 mm/s). The extent of hole-filling was investigated with X-ray analysis. The optimal structure for the prediction method was determined for every approach by varying the size and configuration iteration-wise. Optimal number of hidden neurons was 34 for the full data set and 18 for the smaller ‚Äì incomplete- test cases. The optimal structure for the ANFIS consists of 8 and 6 membership functions respectively. Triangular and Gaussian membership function types and 7 different training methods were assessed. The ANN, which was trained with Bayesien Regularization (prediction error <15%) was found to be the recommended one for the PIP technology. A sensitivity analysis was carried out serving as a basis for managerial implications, which were also described in the paper.

Some researchers explored the task assignment plan for the assembly line balancing problem with the assumption that the assembly process is smooth with no disruption. Other researchers considered the impacts of disruptions, but they only explored the task re-assignment solutions for the assembly line re-balancing problem with the assumption that the re-balancing decision has been made already. There is limited literature exploring on-line adjustment solutions (layout adjustment and production rate adjustment) for an assembly line in a dynamic environment. This is because real-time monitoring of an assembly process was impossible in the past, and it is difficult to incorporate uncertainty factors into the balancing process because of the randomness and non-linearity of these factors. However, Industry 4.0 breaks the information barriers between different parts of an assembly line, since smart, connected products, which are enabled by advanced information and communication technology, can intelligently interact and communicate with each other and collect, process and produce information. Smart control of an assembly line becomes possible with the large amounts of real-time production data in the era of Industry 4.0, but there is little literature considering this new context. In this study, a fuzzy control system is developed to analyze the real-time information of an assembly line, with two types of fuzzy controllers in the fuzzy system. Type 1 fuzzy controller is used to determine whether the assembly line should be re-balanced to satisfy the demand, and type 2 fuzzy controller is used to adjust the production rate of each workstation in time to eliminate blockage and starvation, and increase the utilization of machines. Compared with three assembly lines without the proposed fuzzy control system, the assembly line with the fuzzy control system performs better, in terms of blockage ratio, starvation ratio and buffer level. Additionally, with the improvement of information transparency, the performance of an assembly line will be better. The research findings shed light on the smart control of the assembly process, and provide insights into the impacts of Industry 4.0 on assembly line balancing. ¬© 2019 Elsevier Ltd"

In this paper, a supervised approach for health indicator calculation is provided combining the Grey Wolf Optimisation method, Swarm Intelligence algorithm, and Fuzzy Cognitive Maps. The k-neighbors algorithms is used to predict the Remaining Useful Life of an item, since, in addition to its simplicity, they produce good results in a large number of domains. The approach aims to solve the problem that frequently occurs in interpolation procedures: the approximation of functions belonging to a chosen class of functions of which we have no knowledge. The proposed algorithm allows maintenance managers to distinguish different degradation profiles in depth with a consequently more precise estimate of the Remaining Useful Life of an item and, in addition, an in-depth understanding of the degradation process. Specifically, in order to show its suitability for predictive maintenance, a dataset on NASA aircraft engines has been used and results have been compared to those obtained with a neural network approach. Results highlight how all of the degradation profiles, obtained using the proposed approach, are modelled in a more detailed manner, allowing one to significantly distinguish different situations. Moreover, the physical core speed and the corrected fan speed have been identified as the main critical factors to the engine degradation. ¬© 2021 G. Mazzuto et al."

Hence, analyzing online collected data enables to deal with several industrial issues in real-time such as machines‚Äô break- or slow-downs, quality crisis, flows disruptions, etc. In traditional industrial systems, previous works focused on both scheduling and rescheduling schemes in order to improve the system performance. However, few works dealt with system disruption monitoring due to the lack of real-time data about the system running. Furthermore, the remote and constant monitoring amenities were not established yet, properly. In this paper, we propose a system disruption monitoring tool in Industry 4.0 system. Our tool focuses on system disruption related to resources localization, or when a resource is in an unexpected location. Thus, a machine learning algorithm is used to generate a prediction model of resources localization by considering the real tasks scheduling in terms of resources localization. Therefore, as real resources localization can be collected from the industrial system through the IoT network, our tool enables to detect system disruption, risk, in real-time when comparing predicted localization to the real one. Moreover, our tool is executed in a Fog computing architecture which is emerging as an extension of cloud computing to provide local processing support with good latency.

However, in its development, stakeholders tend to focus on infrastructure and information systems, while the security of information systems is still a comfort zone for industries in the transformation to industry 4.0. The issue of information system security will be a challenge for the industry with open access to information systems; otherwise focus will hamper the business process of the industry. In this research will be discussed about the modeling and implementation of information system security with a combination of web-based security methods with port knocking firewall model and short message service gateway as a security medium with the concept of ease of access with safe and comfortable. The result of this research has been testing penetration testing using network tools. ¬© Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd."

As human operators may support increased flexibility and adaptability to their tasks, they gain an advantage in highly customized productions, where products‚Äô configuration and tasks allocated per workstation may be dynamically changed. In order to support dynamic knowledge transfer to the human operators in a way that is perceivable and does not limit operators‚Äô capabilities, it is important to exploit novel visualization technologies introduced by Industry 4.0. This paper presents an automated approach for remotely supporting assembly workstations, with human operators using augmented reality technology. The system retrieves the workstation‚Äôs schedule and automatically generates assembly instructions, utilizing information from the product‚Äôs design, enriched with order-specific annotations based on product customization. Then, the generated augmented reality instructions are transmitted through a cloud environment to the assembly station operator, aiming to support dynamic production re-scheduling.

Until recently, mixed reality applications have been very demanding in terms of computing power requiring high performance hardware. This paper presents an approach for real-time KPI visualization using mixed reality for bottleneck identification in production lines relying on the bring-your-own device principle. The developed application uses image recognition to identify work stations and visualizes cycle times and work in progress in augmented reality. With this additional information, it is possible to discern different root causes for bottlenecks, for example systematically higher or varying cycle times due to breakdowns. This solution can be classified according to the acatech industry 4.0 maturity model as a level 3 - transparency - application.

The personalized production paradigm which distinguishes Industry 4.0 enables customers to order unique products, defined by the specific features selected.

On the other hand, digital technologies significantly evolved in the last decade and their adoption in industrial shop floors in increasingly wider. In particular, camera-based marker-less motion capture achieved a large popularity since it represents a cheap, reliable and non-invasive solution to track, trace and digitalize human movements in different environments. Considering the presented framework, this research proposes an original hardware/software architecture to assist in real-time operators involved in manual assembly processes during the training phase to support their learning process, both in terms of rate and quality. A marker-less depth camera captures human motions in relation with the workstation environment whereas an augmented reality application based on visual feedback guides the operator through consecutive assembly tasks during the training phase. An experimental campaign is performed at the Learning factory of the Digital production university laboratory to validate the proposed architecture compared to traditional paper-based instructions provided for trainings.

In fact, thanks to the superimposition of the 3D models, as designed by the technical office, a worker can easily detect the presence of design discrepancies on the final physical assembled product and report them by adding 3D annotations directly on virtual models. This AR tool has been developed by using ARCore‚Ñ¢ libraries to ensure, in the first place, its compatibility with commonly used devices for which workers are already trained and, secondly, to take advantage of the hybrid-tracking techniques that combine vision- and sensor-based methods to improve the reliability of the AR visualization. Nevertheless, the proposed AR tool adopts multiple markers to minimize tracking errors and therefore to provide greater freedom of movement to the user, who can use the tool also for the assessment of large-size products. Field experimentations have been carried out on a real case study with end-users in order to assess its usability and perceived mental workload through the SUS (System Usability Scale) and NASA-TLX (Task Load Index) standard questionnaires, respectively. The usability study was performed taking into account also objective metrics, i.e., by analysing user performance in target acquisition tasks while interacting with the AR tool. Statistical analysis proved that the adoption of this AR tool requires low mental demand, and its usability has reached a high level of satisfaction both by the factory workers and engineers involved in the user study. ¬© 2021 Elsevier B.V."

Product development processes are becoming complex as products are getting more versatile and product variations increase the trend of mass customization. Therefore, manufacturing processes need to be more systematic and well-organized to be economically competent and efficient at the same time. The application of Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) technologies may provide effective and innovative solutions in the manufacturing work environment. Especially, AR can help to speed up the assembly process by facilitating the assembly workers to assemble a product without involving into the detailed manual instructions. It may also use as a training aid for new workers to get familiar with the assembly process by visualization and provide easiness in the work. This paper aims to analyse the rationality of digitalization in the manufacturing by using AR technology for a pilot assembling workstation of a cooling unit. An approach to creating digital instructions application by AR was described and the relevance of the approach has shown through a case study. ¬© 2019, Danube Adria Association for Automation and Manufacturing, DAAAM.

We defined the problem of assembly step recognition as a multivariate time series classification using the poses of the workers head, both hands and all relevant tools and objects. With this definition, the VR environment's output can also be replaced with data from the real world. For our proof-of-concept assembly step recognition system, we created an assembly process consisting of six different work steps, five movable assembly parts and one tool.

Current methods, such as physical prototyping are time-consuming and do not offer immediate validation results. Assembly motion simulation systems have been proposed as a solution to this problem. However, widespread adoption of such systems is hindered due to their ties to proprietary computer aided design (CAD) software or expensive and often cumbersome hardware. Recently, virtual/augmented reality (VR/AR) technologies and simulation have been heralded as two of the key enabling factors of Industry 4.0. Collective interests in these technologies by industry and community have brought many low-cost software and hardware tools to the market, which opens a gateway to achieving assembly validation at a much lower cost. This paper presents an assembly validation system that is independent of CAD packages, interoperable and implemented using relatively low-cost and commercially available hardware and software tools. The system features intuitive bare-hand manipulation of part models through a virtual hand model that tracks the hands. Collision detection and physics modelling allow for hand-part and part-part interactions to be natural, thus validating assembly interactions. An assembly feature extraction algorithm has also been implemented to analyse the planar face features of the part models to detect possible mating assembly features between parts concerned. A constraint management system considers identified mating features and determines the allowable motion of parts once constraints are applied and removed. Pulling force is used to facilitate the removal of constraints. ¬© 2019, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature."

Gravity Separation Spirals (GSS) are used in the mining industry to separate slurry into different density components. Currently, spirals are manufactured using moulded polyurethane on fibreglass substructure, or injection moulding. These methods incur significant tooling cost and lead times making them difficult to customise, and they are labour-intensive and can expose workers to hazardous materials. Thus, a 3D printer is under development that can print spirals directly, enabling mass customisation. Furthermore, sensors can be embedded into spirals to measure the operational conditions for predictive maintenance, and to collect data that can improve future manufacturing processes. The localisation of abrasive wear in the GSS is an essential factor in optimising parameters such as suitable material, print thickness, and infill density and thus extend the lifetime and performance of future manufactured spirals. This paper presents the details of a wear sensor, which can be 3D printed directly into the spiral using conductive material. Experimental results show that the sensor can both measure the amount of wear and identify the location of the wear in both the horizontal and vertical axes. Additionally, it is shown that the accuracy can be adjusted according to the requirements by changing the number and spacing of wear lines. ¬© 2019 International Association for Automation and Robotics in Construction I.A.A.R.C.

Such synergy can be achieved when several traditional manufacturing techniques are combined within the production of a single part. One of the most promising combinations is additive manufacturing (AM) with injection molding. AM offers higher production freedom in comparison with traditional techniques. As a result, even very sophisticated geometries can be manufactured by AM at a reasonable price. The bottleneck of AM is the production rate, which is several orders of magnitude slower than that of traditional plastic mass production technologies. On the other hand, injection molding is a manufacturing technique for high‚Äêvolume production with little possibility of customization. The customization of injection‚Äêmolded parts is usually very expensive and time‚Äêconsuming. In this research, we offered a solution for the individualization of mass production, which includes 3D printing a baseplate with the subsequent overmolding of a rib element on it. We examined the bonding between the additive‚Äêmanufactured component and the injection‚Äêmolded component. As bonding strength between the coupled elements is significantly lower than the strength of the material, we proposed five strategies to improve bonding strength. The strategies are optimizing the printing parameters to obtain high surface roughness, creating an infill density in fused filament fabrication (FFF) parts, creating local infill density, creating microstructures, and incorporating fibers into the bonding area. We observed that the two most effective methods to increase bonding strength are the creation of local infill density and the creation of a microstructure at the contact area of FFFprinted and injection‚Äêmolded elements.

This process is based on a developed framework for the design of modern automated and computerized infrastructure. The task of the described system is to combine all the steps included in the operating range of incremental systems based on an IT platform by integrating data from individual areas, such as IT systems supporting remote 3D printing. The proposed framework for incremental processes is a universal solution that can be defined in detail by a single organizational unit running 3D printing, as well as by a cluster of entities related to 3D printing. In the initial phase, the framework design includes a set of guidelines for IT (Information Technology) systems that facilitate the construction of individual elements and the creation of communication interfaces. In subsequent stages, the framework may already implement elements of the access and communication program interface, as well as guidelines for the industrial components to be included. The proposed framework for additive technologies is based on modern IT tools that enable the creation of geographically and functionally possible prototyping systems that can be integrated into the structure of Industry 4.0. To create optimal processes and economic systems, the principles of the construction and integration of individual services and equipment were developed. This new comprehensive approach is proposed in the present paper as a coherent framework. Moreover, the proposed solution has great potential for use in the design and production processes of various industries, such as chemicals, materials and construction. ¬© 2020 by the authors."

The cyber-physical system (CPS) is a concept closely connected with Industry 4.0 that can form a basis for creating a Digital Twin. In this paper, a comprehensive model of a Digital Twin approach for a manufacturing environment and related production processes is proposed. The presented model is based on combining a 5-Dimensional definition for the Digital Twin and cloud-based CPS (C2PS) architecture. The model consists of five layers to replicate the physical object as a virtual object and to collect and convert data. Analysis of the virtual model for prediction of future development, decision-making, re-configuration, what-if analysis, and understanding of the effect of changes in the real time process is performed in the fourth layer. The user interface layer is the connection between the virtual and physical model. Use of a Digital Twin in manufacturing enables improvement in the effectiveness of Lean Manufacturing, leading to savings in resources such as cost and time. Uncertainties inherent in manufacturing processes mean that the Digital Twin approach is a more suitable method for optimization of the overall process and the sub-processes than pure simulation. An accurate Digital Twin model can improve safety, save costs, speed up manufacturing of new products and implementation of new processes, and provide global optimization results. In practice, however, provision of data is a challenge to use of the Digital Twin approach because modern manufacturing uses a variety of data in different formats with different owners. Access to all required data and information and obtaining permission for its use in creation of a Digital Twin is a topic for future research. ¬© 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

However, the scarce adoption of guidelines and standards within the industrial practice of PLC programming complicates this context. To face this challenge, this paper proposes a methodology for PLC code to standardize the vocabulary and the management of the operational modes of industrial automation systems.

The advancement of Digital Twin technologies allows for realistic simulations of complex machinery; therefore, it is ideally suited to generate synthetic datasets for the use in anomaly detection approaches when compared to actual measurement data. In this article, we present novel weakly supervised approaches to anomaly detection for industrial settings. The approaches make use of a Digital Twin to generate a training dataset, which simulates the normal operation of the machinery, along with a small set of labeled anomalous measurement from the real machinery. In particular, we introduce a clustering-based approach, called cluster centers (CC), and a neural architecture based on the Siamese Autoencoders (SAE), which are tailored for weakly supervised settings with very few labeled data samples. The performance of the proposed methods is compared against various state-of-the-art anomaly detection algorithms on an application to a real-world dataset from a facility monitoring system, by using a multitude of performance measures. Also, the influence of hyperparameters related to feature extraction and network architecture is investigated. We find that the proposed SAE-based solutions outperform state-of-the-art anomaly detection approaches very robustly for many different hyperparameter settings on all performance measures. ¬© 2005-2012 IEEE."

However, retrofitting changes according to the type and model of industrial equipment, making it challenging to upgrade industrial equipment to Cyber-Physical Production Systems (CPPS). In this paper, the standardization of the retrofitting process to transform old equipment into a CPPS is presented. The standardization is done with the support of a platform that has features to work independently of the model or type of equipment.

However, with the manual control setting, it is difficult to achieve an accurate quality assessment of an automated process characterized by high uncertainty and intricacy. It is challenging to replace handicrafts and the versatility of manual product customization with automation techniques. Hence, the current study has developed an automatic production line with a cyber-physical system artificial intelligence (CPS-AI) architecture for the complete manufacturing of soft fabric shoe tongues. The Deep-Q reinforcement learning (RL) method is proposed as a means of achieving better control over the manufacturing process, while the convolutional and long short-term memory artificial neural network (CNN + LSTM) is developed to enhance action speed. This technology allows a robotic arm to learn the specific image feature points of a shoe tongue through repeated training to improve its manufacturing accuracy. For validation, different parameters of the network architecture are tested, and the test convergence accuracy was found to be as high as 95.9 %. During its actual implementation, the production line completed 509 finished products, of which 349 products were acceptable due to the anticipated measurement error. This showed that the production line system was capable of achieving optimum product accuracy and quality with respect to the performance of repeated computations, parameter updates, and action evaluations. ¬© 2020 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers"

Wireless local area networks (WLANs), such as Bluetooth low energy (BLE) and Wi-Fi, have the advantages of a high bandwidth and transmission speed. However, they have drawbacks, such as their limited transmission distances and the high likelihood of interference from other floors. Therefore, the applicability of wireless teleoperated control in complex factory environments is limited when a WLAN is used. The objective of the present study was to develop a portable long range (LoRa)-based teleoperation controller (PLTC) to solve this problem. LoRa is a low-power wide-area network (LPWAN) technology, which is a suitable approach to communication for PLTCs owing to its physical characteristics of long distance and low frequency. Accordingly, we designed an intuitive teleoperation controller with an inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensor and processed the attitude signal using a complementary filter to operate a robotic arm stably. The IMU is an effective and generally applicable sensor for measuring the attitude of devices. Finally, we integrated a LoRa module and a robotic arm to realize long-distance teleoperation control in a harsh factory environment.

Our proposed algorithm aims to minimize the cloud provider's revenue and the usage of nonrenewable energy by utilizing the real-world electricity prices with the availability of green energy on different cloud data centers, where the energy consumption consists of the usage of running application over multiple data centers and transferring the data among them through SDWAN. The evaluation shows that our proposed method can increase usage of green energy for the execution of industrial workflow up to 3\times times with a slight increase in the cost when compared to cost-based workflow scheduling methods. ¬© 2005-2012 IEEE."

Large numbers of machines and products are equipped with sensors to constantly monitor their condition. Usually, the condition of an entire system is inferred through sensors in parts of the system by means of a multiplicity of methods and techniques. This so-called condition monitoring can thus reduce the downtime costs of a machine through improved maintenance scheduling. However, for small components as well as relatively inexpensive or immutable parts of a machine, sometimes it is not possible or uneconomical to embed sensors. We propose a system-oriented concept of how to monitor individual components of a complex technical system without including additional sensor technology. By using already existing sensors from the environment combined with machine learning techniques, we are able to infer the condition of a system component, without actually observing it. In consequence condition monitoring or additional services based on the component's behavior can be developed without overcoming the challenges of sensor implementation. ¬© 2019 IEEE Computer Society.

Existing database systems can be exchanged with Blockchain systems, thus making use of its inherent immutability. Popular open-source Blockchain frameworks such as Hyperledger Fabric offer large customizability, which makes them attractive for dynamic Industry 4.0 applications.

Due to its high flexibility and numerous configuration parameters, an interested developer needs to have a deep understanding or even some experience with the Hyperledger Fabric framework. Since most SMEs do not have a dedicated IT department, this paper aims to provide a design guideline for interested developers to optimally set up a Hyperledger Fabric v2.0 business network, which is suited for the desired use-case. With the special demands of Industry 4.0 in mind, this paper also provides three example use-cases, which can benefit from the use of DLT to enhance data security.

In this sense, this work proposes anomaly detection methods. These methods are usually time-consuming and limited in scope since they are derived for addressing a single protocol. Thus, this work proposes a general and accurate anomaly detection technique suitable for any protocol based on RTE. ANN-based and SVM-based classifiers are used for classifying data traffic events based on the most relevant features extracted from data sets. An optimal sliding window approach is used for extracting these data sets, which improves the accuracy of the proposal. Seven different classifiers are investigated. Firstly, a Perceptron Neural Network is applied for verifying if the data sets are linearly separable. If this first classifier is unable to reach the required accuracy, three ANN-based classifiers with different activation functions and three SVM-based classifiers with different kernels are employed. The use of several classifiers not only improves the accuracy but also eliminates the need for advanced knowledge about communication dynamics. The generality and accuracy of the proposal are evaluated for detecting traffic events using real traffic data of a real automotive plant. PROFINET, Ethernet/IP, and SERCOS III networks have been analyzed, showing that some traffic events can be classified using the Perceptron while others require the use of more complex classifiers achieving accuracy greater than 98%. ¬© 2021 Elsevier B.V."

Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF) is a widespread and practical tool for rapid prototyping that also demonstrates the importance of AM technologies through its accessibility to the general public by creating cost effective desktop solutions. An increasing integration of systems in an intelligent production environment also enables the generation of large-scale data to be used for process monitoring and process control. Deep learning as a form of artificial intelligence (AI) and more specifically, a method of machine learning (ML) is ideal for handling big data. This study uses a trained artificial neural network (ANN) model as a digital shadow to predict the force within the nozzle of an FFF printer using filament speed and nozzle temperatures as input data. After the ANN model was tested using data from a theoretical model it was implemented to predict the behavior using real-time printer data. For this purpose, an FFF printer was equipped with sensors that collect real time printer data during the printing process. The ANN model reflected the kinematics of melting and flow predicted by models currently available for various speeds of printing. The model allows for a deeper understanding of the influencing process parameters which ultimately results in the determination of the optimum combination of process speed and print quality. ¬© 2021, The Author(s)."

Unscheduled breakdowns increase operating costs due to repairs and production losses. Scheduled maintenance implies taking the risk of replacing fully operational components. Human expertise is a solution for an outstanding expertise but at a high cost and for a limited quantity of data only, the analysis being time-consuming. Industry 4.0 and digital factory offer many alternatives to human monitoring. Time, cost and skills are the real stakes. The key point is how to automate each part of the process knowing that each one is valuable. Leaving aside scheduled maintenance, this paper copes with condition-based preventive maintenance and focuses on one fundamental step: the signal processing. After a brief overview of this specific area in which numerous technologies already exist, this paper argues for an automated signal processing at an expert level. The objective is to monitor a system over days, weeks, or years with as great accuracy as a human expert, and even better in regard to data investigation and analysis efficiency. After a data validation step most often ignored, any multimodal signal (vibration, current, acoustic, ‚Ä¶) is processed over its entire frequency band in view of identifying all harmonic families and their sidebands. Sophisticated processing such as filtering and demodulation creates relevant features describing the fine complex structures of each spectrum. A time‚Äìfrequency feature tracking constructs trends over time to not only detect a failure but also to characterize and localize it.

This article discussed and researched the intrusion prevention technology of industrial control networks based on deep learning. According to the electromagnetic scattering theory, the backscatter signal model of the chipless tag was established as a chipless tag structure. Polarized deep learning coding was used for the label; that was, deep learning coding was performed on the copolarization component and the cross-polarization component at the same time, and a 16-bit deep learning coding bit number was obtained. The wave crest deep learning coding was used for the split ellipse ring patch label, and the 6-bit deep learning coding bit number was obtained. Then, the poles of the scattered signal of the tag were extracted to identify the tag. The variable polarization effect was achieved by adopting the dipole resonant unit with the two ends bent. Aiming at the problem of low detection rate caused by the shallow selection of feature classification of intrusion prevention systems, an industrial control network intrusion prevention model based on self-deep learning encoders and extreme learning machines was proposed to extract features from industrial control network data through deep learning. For accurate classification, the theoretical judgment was also verified through simulation experiments, and it was proved that the detection rate of the model has also improved. It forms a set of industrial control network intrusion prevention system with complete functions and superior performance with data acquisition module, system log module, defense response module, central control module, etc. The matrix beam algorithm was used to extract the poles and residues for the late response, and the extracted poles and residues were used to reconstruct the signal. The reconstructed signal was compared with the scattered signal to verify the correctness of the pole extraction. Finally, the tags were processed and tested in the actual environment, and the measured results were consistent with the theoretical analysis and simulation results. ¬© 2021 Guolong Shi et al."

The literature shows that in industry 4.0, intelligent cloud based additive manufacturing plays a crucial role. Considering this, few studies have accomplished an integration of the intelligent additive manufacturing and the service oriented manufacturing paradigms. This is due to the lack of prerequisite frameworks to enable this integration. These frameworks should create an autonomous platform for cloud based service composition for additive manufacturing based on customer demands. One of the most important requirements of customer processing in autonomous manufacturing platforms is the interpretation of the product shape; as a result, accurate and automated shape interpretation plays an important role in this integration. Unfortunately despite this fact, accurate shape interpretation has not been a subject of research studies in the additive manufacturing, except limited studies aiming machine level production process. This paper has proposed a framework to interpret shapes, or their informative two dimensional pictures, automatically by decomposing them into simpler shapes which can be categorized easily based on provided training data. To do this, two algorithms which apply a Recurrent Neural Network and a two dimensional Convolutional Neural Network as decomposition and recognition tools respectively are proposed. These two algorithms are integrated and case studies are designed to demonstrate the capabilities of the proposed platform. The results suggest that considering the complex objects which can be decomposed with planes perpendicular to one axis of Cartesian coordination system and parallel withother two, the decomposition algorithm can even give results using an informative 2D image of the object. ¬© 2021.

This means that the production of workpiece places more emphasis on the smart realization of the process level in Industry 4.0. However, how to implement the production scenario based on existing technologies has not yet been well studied. On account of this, this article aims to study how to use existing technologies in job shop such as digital twins, Internet of Things (IoT), Cyber-physical Production System (CPPS), etc., to realize the workpiece-driven process-level production. The process-level production of a workpiece is divided into three stages according to the different manufacturing resources involved. On this basis, the production of the workpiece in digital twin job shop is divided into process level, operation level, and IoT/sensor level. Firstly, the manufacturing requirements at process level are generated according to production planning and process sheet. And these requirements are written into RFID tag of the workpiece. The workpiece dynamically interacts with different workstations via RFID reader/antenna in order to complete the manufacturing requirements. Secondly, based on the tag data, the interaction model of operation level, and IoT/sensor level CPPSs is given. Thirdly, at IoT/sensor level, the RFID devices are treated as a CPPS to track the manufacturing resources.

The primary motive for writing this article was in cooperation with a Slovak wood processing company, which wanted to improve its logistics processes and increase competitiveness in the wood processing sector through the implementation of new technologies. The aim of this article was to identify the positives and limitations of the implementation of Internet of Things (IoT) technology into the wood processing industry, based on a secondary analysis of case studies and the best practice of American wood processing companies such as West Fraser Timber in Canada, and Weyerhaeuser in the USA. The selection of case studies was conditional on criteria of time relevance, size of the sawmills, and production volume in m3. These conditional criteria reflected the conditions for the introduction of similar concepts for wood-processing enterprises in Slovakia. The implementation of the IoT can reduce operating costs by up to 20%, increase added value for customers, and collect real-time data that can serve as the basis for support of management and decision-making at the operational, tactical, and strategic levels. In addition to the secondary analysis, methods of comparison of global wood processing companies, synthesis of knowledge, and summarization of positives and limitations of IoT implementation or deduction were used to reach our conclusions. The results were used as the basis for the design of a general model for the implementation of IoT technology for Slovak wood processing enterprises. This model may represent best practice for the selected locality and industry. The implications and verification of the designed model in practice will form part of other research activities, already underway in the form of a primary survey. ¬© 2020 by the authors."

To integrate the production data from aPS and to make it available for data analysis and plant monitoring, relevant data from the programmable logic controller (PLC) of each aPS needs to be accessed and forwarded. These PLCs, at a first priority, control the production plants and ensure reliable production. Due to the long life-cycles of aPS of around 30 years, a huge number of legacy PLCs with limited processing and communication capabilities exists in the field. Therefore, retrofitting concepts that aim to allow access to PLC data need to account for this special, mission-critical role of PLCs. In the context of PLC retrofitting approaches, research currently addresses two domains: on the one hand, abstract Industrie 4.0 architectures are proposed that lack of implementation details. On the other hand, specific retrofitting concepts are presented, which are usually not transferable to other application purposes.Hence, this work aims to fill this gap by deriving generally applicable retrofitting strategies for legacy PLCs for data collection. Five technology-neutral retrofitting concepts based on industrially relevant use-cases were proposed. Three concepts were substantiated on an exemplary basis and their validity shown within a proof-of-concept. Altogether, this work can act as a guideline for retrofitting automation technology to facilitate the integration of legacy systems in Industrie 4.0 scenarios. ¬© 2021 IEEE."

One of the most studied information visualization technologies is Augmented Reality (AR), whose deployment via mobile devices is currently being promoted. However, the industrial sector still has doubts regarding the technology's maturity and the costs incurred by such production processes, restricting its deployment in production environments. Thus, in the present study, we statistically analyze a markerless AR application, using a hand-held mobile device, that addresses the requirements of the structural assemblies used in aeronautical industries comparing them to those of traditional assembly methods. The main technological benefits and limitations of such applications are identified. To perform this analysis, we conducted a field evaluation where qualified professionals marked the positions of small brackets in an aeronautical structure by using AR. After collecting the time and measurement data for each bracket's position, a statistical analysis was performed to compare these positionings against those achieved using a traditional, metric scale-based method. The results indicate that AR offers a faster solution for highly complex assemblies, despite several limitations regarding the positioning tolerance when using the technology. As a future study, several application modifications are suggested to reduce markup errors and overall usage time. ¬© 2020 Elsevier Ltd"

Mold manufacturing involves several operations and one of the most critical is the one related to mold surface welding. The main goal here is to insert a more durable metal into specific areas of the mold to create regions with enhanced characteristics (e.g. improved wear resistance) in order to improve the quality and durability of the mold. Such an operation typically involves three steps, namely: i) mold preheating, ii) manipulation and iii) welding. Overall, this is a rather complex process, demanding tight control and monitoring of its variables. Our industrial partner, a medium-size manufacturer of molds for glass bottles, already had an extensively automated manufacturing process. However, there were frequent reports of processing flaws during the welding stage (e.g. quality of metal deposition, fissures, welding pores) with the mold being lost in some cases. The reasons behind most of the reported flaws were difficult to discern from the available sensors and methods. From our early assessment it became clear that the range of sensors available during the welding operation was insufficient and that the communication between the machines inside the production cell was either too simple or disconnected from the rest of the factory. This resulted in an absence of an integrated record of the production process. In view of this, it was necessary to develop and implement a digitalization plan, which we describe in this paper, of the production cell responsible for mold surface welding. As a result of this planning, additional sensors were introduced to the production cell, related to pressure, temperature, humidity, flow, and voltage. The intent here was to have monitoring variables that could be used to diagnose and/or prognosticate problems in the process. Also, since the sensors lacked integration, a network was established using IoT technologies supported by the PlugThings Framework together with Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) technology. The PlugThings, an IoT platform developed by our partner iTime, acted as a mediator between the sensor network and a Web server. The IoT platform also allowed to perform the vertical integration of the process, from sensors on the production cell to the Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system. Finally, this initiative enabled access to charting tools and to data in the form of XML files. Currently, the system in undergoing exhaustive tests before expanding to other production cells in the shop floor. Future steps will involve the use of analytics and artificial intelligence to diagnose and predict failures of the manufacturing process and to better streamline production. ¬© 2020 The Authors.

In this work we propose a Time Delay Neural Network (TDNN) applied to low level data for the automatic recognition of different process phases in industrial collaborative tasks. We selected TDNN because they are suited for modelling time dependent processes over long sequences while maintaining computational efficiency. To experimentally evaluate the recognition performance and the generalization capability of the proposed method, we acquired two novel datasets reproducing a typical IMS setting. Datasets (including manually annotated ground-truth labels) are publicly available to enable other methods to be tested on them and they replicate typical Industry 4.0 setting. The first dataset replicates a collaborative robotic environment where a human operator interacts with a robotic manipulator in the execution of a pick and place task. The second set represents a human tele-operated robotic assisted manipulation for assembly applications. The obtained results are superior to other methods available in literature and demonstrate an improved computational performance. ¬© 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

The gap seen by Manufacturing SME's from their current status, to where they believe they need to align with Industry 4.0, can be seen an unsurmountable barrier blocking the technological move forward necessary for those enterprises [3]. However, Industry 4.0 need not be implemented all at once. Enterprises should follow incremental steps of improving operations and identifying where digital integration with suppliers, the shop floor and customers will deliver operational benefits [4, 5]. This paper describes an EU funded experiment, co-ordinated by a regional Digital Innovation Hub (DIH) aimed at the introduction of digitization of production operations in a manufacturing SME. The changes made by an Irish Precision Engineering SME towards integration of operator reporting, from manual to electronic format are presented. The benefits through cost effective methods to the organization, of small transformations are described. The technology used included MTConnect, IoT devices and open source software components from the BEinCPPS architecture. This facilitated the acquisition of production data and the energy monitoring of machines from the factory floor to a central repository where data analytics tools generated Key Performance Indicators (KPI's) for visualization on shop floor and mobile dashboards. The experiment showed how the use of commercial off the shelf technology, integrated with the facility's Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system reduced daily production management tasks improved the management of equipment and resources while easing the burden on reporting by machine operators. The SME Management have gained awareness of the benefits of digitization taken in manageable steps and as a result are now engaged in further transformation within the organization. ¬© 2019 The Authors.

Promising technologies are connected to the speeding up of production stages like fast algorithms for object localization, as well as dexterous grippers for manipulation and assembly. Nowadays, most of the solutions for pick and place tasks involve the use of robotic grippers for grasping objects, while robotic manipulators are responsible for their accurate placements. Focusing on the grippers, although their simple structure can be appreciated, it greatly reduces their in-hand manipulation abilities, making unfeasible the twists of grasped objects and their release in a desired pose. As consequence, the efficiency of the pick and place operation is reduced since several adjustments of the robotic arm are required to accomplish the task. In this paper, a novel dexterous gripper coupled with a vision system algorithm for object localization and pose estimation are presented, and their performances in manipulating different objects are discussed. The designed gripper has a symmetrical structure with two finger modules, each one consisting in a couple of linear actuators arranged mutually orthogonal, so the translations in two axis, namely y and z directions, are allowed. As terminal part of each finger there is a revolute joint to whom is attached a fingertip modelled according to the shape of the target objects and easily replaceable. The embedded vision system algorithm adopted estimates position and orientation of the objects on a flat surface, and it coordinates the gripper placement to grasp them. The case study of the handling of a Spanish fan is presented and discussed in details. ¬© 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Between those machines, a massive exchange of data and sensitive information is taking place. Whenever there is a new interface between networks and devices, it poses a weak link and is marked as potential attack point. As more devices enter the realm of Internet of Things, attacks aimed at the variety of Internet-endpoints will grow. However, existing internet technologies are plagued by data privacy issues and malicious breaches that will act as a setback for adopters of Industry 4.0 technologies. Thus, the need for identifying the required cybersecurity protocols, at specific endpoints where data leaks may occur, has been vastly increased to tackle malicious behaviors. The true potential of Industry 4.0 cannot be achieved, if those challenges are not addressed properly.

In this paper, an innovative approach is proposed in order to contribute to the current collection of applications of Digital Twin in manufacturing: a Digital Shadow cloud-based application to enhance quality control in the manufacturing process. In particular, the proposal comprises a Digital Shadow updated on high performance computing cloud infrastructure in order to recompute the performance prediction adopting a variation of the computer-aided engineering model shaped like the actual manufactured part. Thus, this methodology could make possible the qualification of even not compliant parts, and so shift the focus from the compliance to tolerance requirements to the compliance to usage requirements. The process is demonstrated adopting two examples: the structural assessment of the geometry of a shaft and the one of a simplified turbine blade.

It is characterised by a high degree of intercommunication, embedded computation, resulting in a decentralised and distributed handling of data. Additionally, cloud-storage and Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) approaches enhance a centralised storage and handling of data. This often takes place in third-party networks. Furthermore, Industry 4.0 is driven by novel business cases. Lot sizes of one, customer individual production, observation of process state and progress in real-time and remote maintenance, just to name a few. All of these new business cases make use of the novel technologies. However, cyber security has not been an issue in industry. Industrial networks have been considered physically separated from public networks. Additionally, the high level of uniqueness of any industrial network was said to prevent attackers from exploiting flaws. Those assumptions are inherently broken by the concept of Industry 4.0. As a result, an abundance of attack vectors is created. In the past, attackers have used those attack vectors in spectacular fashions. Especially Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) in Germany struggle to adapt to these challenges. Reasons are the cost required for technical solutions and security professionals. In order to enable SMEs to cope with the growing threat in the cyberspace, the research project IUNO Insec aims at providing and improving security solutions that can be used without specialised security knowledge.

To address these demands, future plants must be highly flexible and dynamically reconfigurable. Current systems are usually based on wired technologies for the connection of sensors, actuators, and controlling or monitoring devices that allow only very limited dynamics. New applications, such as the use of robots, drones, or reconfigurable production lines, require the exploitation of wireless communication technologies. However, current technologies are not able to meet the high requirements in terms of latency, robustness, resilience and data rate. The introduction of the 5th generation (5G) cellular communication system will meet these requirements for the first time. Besides the use of radio-based solutions in new plants - so-called greenfield scenarios - deploying 5G also represents an efficient migration of existing plants - so-called brownfield scenarios - to Industry 4.0. In order to ensure that the challenging requirements are indeed meet in practical deployments of the new 5G technology, a tailor-made architecture is being developed within the Tactile Internet 4.0 (TACNET 4.0) project. As a basis for the design of the architecture, representative Industry 4.0 application scenarios, which are also be considered by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP), were analyzed and compliance with the latest developments in the relevant standardization is also our target.

Interconnected users, i.e. suppliers and customers, offer and request manufacturing services over a cloud manufacturing platform, where an intelligent engine generates a number of solutions based on functional and geometrical requirements. A high number of suppliers leads to a higher number of solutions available for customers increasing the decision-making complexity from a customer perspective. Recommendation systems play a crucial role in expanding the opportunities in decision-making processes under complex information environments. In this scope, this paper proposes the conceptualization and the development of a recommendation decision support tool to be implemented in a cloud manufacturing platform to assist customers in appropriately selecting manufacturing services with reference to sheet metal cutting operations. In terms of solution selection, a Deep Neural Network (DNN) paradigm is adopted to allow for the automatic learning of optimal solution recommendation list based both on customers past experiences and new choices. In this respect, a virtual interaction environment is firstly built for system pre-training. Subsequently, users' data are inputted in the pre-trained model to predict a recommendation list. This is then subject to user interaction, i.e. selection, which will be fed back into the model to update the training parameters. This paper concludes with a simulated case study reported to exemplify the proposed methodology for a variety of decision-making scenarios. ¬© 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V."

If the supports are not well placed, the flexible composite parts will deform due to machining forces. They will, for example, bend during the drilling process, leading to delamination and frayed edges. The high cutting forces caused by the anisotropic properties, high stiffness, and high abrasiveness of carbon fibers in composite materials are leading to high cutting tool wear. In this paper, we propose two innovative technologies to reduce the problems described above. A patented technology that allows to maximize the stability of the composite parts to be machined and afford a high quality of machined parts. A monitoring technology that directly estimates at any time the cutting tool wear-out in three dimensions. The validation results of these two technologies prove high accuracy and robustness in industrial machining conditions. Moreover, both technologies are cost-effective and allow to collect relevant process information that can be deployed to transform a conventional machining center into an Industry 4.0 compatible (smart) machining center. ¬© 2nd CIRP Conference on Composite Material Parts Manufacturing,CIRP-CCMPM 2019.

In this paper, a big data ecosystem is presented for the implementation of fault detection and diagnosis in predictive maintenance with real industrial big data gathered directly from large-scale global manufacturing plants, aiming to provide a complete architecture which could be used in industrial IoT-based smart manufacturing in an industrial 4.0 system. The proposed architecture overcomes multiple challenges including big data ingestion, integration, transformation, storage, analytics, and visualization in a real-time environment using various technologies such as the data lake, NoSQL database, Apache Spark, Apache Drill, Apache Hive, OPC Collector, and other techniques. Transformation protocols, authentication, and data encryption methods are also utilized to address data and network security issues. A MapReduce-based distributed PCA model is designed for fault detection and diagnosis. In a large-scale manufacturing system, not all kinds of failure data are accessible, and the absence of labels precludes all the supervised methods in the predictive phase. Furthermore, the proposed framework takes advantage of some of the characteristics of PCA such as its ease of implementation on Spark, its simple algorithmic structure, and its real-time processing ability. All these elements are essential for smart manufacturing in the evolution to Industry 4.0. The proposed detection system has been implemented into the real-time industrial production system in a cooperated company, running for several years, and the results successfully provide an alarm warning several days before the fault happens.

Sensors collect the real-time data required to optimise manufacturing processes and are therefore a key technology in this transformation. Ultrasonic sensors have benefits of being low-cost, in-line, non-invasive, and able to operate in opaque systems. Supervised machine learning models can correlate ultrasonic sensor data to useful information about the manufacturing materials and processes. However, this requires a reference measurement of the process material to label each data point for model training. Labelled data is often difficult to obtain in factory environments, and so a method of training models without this is desirable. This work compares two domain adaptation methods to transfer models across processes, so that no labelled data is required to accurately monitor a target process. The two method compared are a Single Feature transfer learning approach and Transfer Component Analysis using three features. Ultrasonic waveforms are unique to the sensor used, attachment procedure, and contact pressure. Therefore, only a small number of transferable features are investigated. Two industrially relevant processes were used as case studies: mixing and cleaning of fouling in pipes. A reflection-mode ultrasonic sensing technique was used, which monitors the sound wave reflected from the interface between the vessel wall and process material. Overall, the Single Feature method produced the highest prediction accuracies: up to 96.0% and 98.4% to classify the completion of mixing and cleaning, respectively; and R2 values of up to 0.947 and 0.999 to predict the time remaining until completion. These results highlight the potential of combining ultrasonic measurements with transfer learning techniques to monitor industrial processes. Although, further work is required to study various effects such as changing sensor location between source and target domains. ¬© 2021 Elsevier B.V."

Therefore, it is necessary to propose a robust and functional communication architecture that is based on WSNs, inside factories, in order to show the great interest in the connectivity of things in the industrial environment. In such environment, propagation differs from other conventional indoor mediums, in its large dimensions, and the nature of objects and obstacles inside.

As an integral part of the development of such algorithms, a reference dataset representative of normal operating conditions is required to evaluate the stability of the process and, after confirming that it is stable, to calibrate a monitoring procedure, i.e., estimate the reference model and set the control limits for the monitoring statistics. The basic assumption is that all relevant ‚Äúcommon causes‚Äù of variation appear well represented in this reference dataset (using the terminology adopted by the founding father of process monitoring, Walter A. Shewhart). Otherwise, false alarms will inevitably occur during the implementation of the monitoring scheme. However, we argue and demonstrate in this article, that this assumption is often not met in modern industrial systems. Therefore, we introduce a new approach based on the rigorous mechanistic modeling of the dominant modes of common cause variation and the use of stochastic computational simulations to enrich the historical dataset with augmented data representing a comprehensive coverage of the actual operational space. We show how to compute the monitoring statistics and set their control limits, as well as to conduct fault diagnosis when an abnormal event is declared.

Access to the multiple benefits of digitalization (such as increased productivity, flexibility, efficiency, quality, lower consumption of resources, and the improvement of worker safety) is possible by purchasing new-generation machinery. However, thanks to smart retrofitting processes, companies can extend the shelf life of machinery without replacing it entirely. This work aims to present a framework to assess the sustainability of implementing a smart retrofitting process in old machines as an alternative to replacement from a triple bottom line (economic, environmental, and social) perspective. Due to the multidimensional and multidisciplinary variables that the proposed framework must consider, a multicriteria decision-making process is developed to identify the best transition solution from Industry 3.0 to 4.0. Then, we analyze a case study in which, thanks to the previously proposed methodology, two types of smart retrofitting on a column drill are compared with three replacement options for the same machine tool. In conclusion, the case study shows that retrofitting in the context of Industry 4.0 (or smart retrofitting), despite its high acquisition cost, is the best solution in terms of sustainability, and that this is because the smart retrofitting solution not only positively influences all parameters of digitization but also has a strong impact on the safety criterion. ¬© 2021 by the authors.

Moreover, recent results and industrial proofs of concept show that these technologies demonstrate critical advantages in the industry. Nevertheless, the authoring and editing process of virtual and augmented content remains time-consuming, especially in complex industrial scenarios. While the use of interactive virtual environments through virtual and augmented reality presents new possibilities for many domains, a wider adoption of VR/AR is possible only if the authoring process is simplified, allowing for more rapid development and configuration without the need for advanced IT skills. To meet this goal, this study presents a new framework: INTERVALES. First, framework architecture is proposed, along with its different modules; this study then shows that the framework can be updated by not only IT workers, but also other job experts. The UML data model is presented to format and simplify the authoring processes for both VR and AR. This model takes into account virtual and augmented environments, the possible interactions, and ease operations orchestration. Finally, this paper presents the implementation of an industrial use case composed of collaborative robotic (cobotic) and manual assembly workstations in VR and AR based on INTERVALES data. ¬© 2021 Elsevier Ltd"

Due to the advancement of technology and the realizations of Industry 4.0, smart factories demand high precision and accuracy in the measurements and inspection of industrial gears. Machine vision technology provides image-based inspection and analysis for such demanding applications. With the use of software, sensors, cameras, and robot guidance, such integrated systems can be realized. The aim of this paper is to deploy an improved machine vision application to determine the precise measurement of industrial gears, at subpixel level, with the potential to improve quality control, reduce downtime, and optimize the inspection process. A machine vision application (Vision2D) has been developed to acquire and analyze captured images to implement the process of measurement and inspection. Firstly, a very minimum calibration error of 0.06 pixel was obtained after calibration. The calibrated vision system was verified by measuring a ground-truth sample gear in a Coordinate Measuring Machine (CMM), using the parameter generated as the nominal value of the outer diameter. A methodical study of the global uncertainty associated with the process is carried out in order to know better the admissible zone for accepting gears. After that, the proposed system analyzed twelve other samples with a nominal tolerance threshold of ¬± 0.020 mm. Amongst the gears inspected, the Vision2D application identified eight gears which are accepted and four bad gears which are rejected. The inspection result demonstrates an improvement in the algorithm of the Vision2D system application when compared with the previous existing algorithms. ¬© 2019, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature."

Specifically, we define two signaling strategies where we exploit the Modbus/transmission control protocol (TCP) as target to set up a covert channel. Once the threat channel is established, passive and active offensive methodologies are further exploited by implementing and testing them on a real industrial Internet of Things testbed.

It is considered as one of the pillars or component of Industry 4.0. With the advancements in technology, digital manufacturing is becoming a reality rather than a concept only. It is applied to various stages of the manufacturing process such as design, prototyping, and assembly training. Virtual reality (VR) is a cog in a wheel of digital manufacturing. It can be used in various phases of manufacturing. Planning and conducting assembly operations account for the majority of the cost of a product. It is difficult to design and train assembly operations during the early stages of product design. Assembly is a vital step in manufacturing, so firms provide training to their employees and it costs them time and money. Therefore, this research work extends VR applications in manufacturing by integrating concepts and studies from training simulations to the evaluation of assembly training effectiveness and transfer of training. VR provides a platform for ‚Äúlearning by doing‚Äù instead of learning by seeing, listening, or observing. A series of user-based evaluation studies are conducted to ensure that the virtual manufacturing assembly simulation provides an effective and efficient means for evaluating assembly operations and for training assembly personnel. Different feedback cues of VR are implemented to evaluate the system. Moreover, several case studies are used to assess the effectiveness of VR-based training. The results of the study reveal that participants trained by VR committed fewer errors and took lesser time in actual product assembly when compared against the participant from traditional or baseline training group. ¬© 2019, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature."

Accordingly, in this research, 12 different online data sources in the injection molding process are evaluated to determine their relative degree of importance in predicting variations on final part quality indices, namely part weight, thickness, and diameter. These data are obtained during each injection molding cycle using a data acquisition system connected to eight in-mold sensors and four machine data sources. Three distinct types of perturbations are introduced into the process to challenge the range of detection capacities of these various data sources: shot size variations, material disturbances, and shutdown of the mold cooling system. The resultant curves from these studies are then analyzed for critical values, and partial least square (PLS) regressions performed using the extracted values as predictors and the final part quality indices as responses. Using the standard coefficients from the PLS analysis, rankings of the correlations between the extracted values and final part quality indices are generated, indicating which data sources best detected variations in the final produced parts for each of the three perturbations. ¬© 2019, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature."

We evaluated the performance of several machine learning techniques commonly used to detect anomalies (i.e. OCSVM, kNN, AutoEnconder), in order to determine if they could be useful to detect such faults.

With HP‚Äôs Multi-jet Fusion technology relatively recent entry (2014) into a seemingly stagnant scene of industrial scale powder-based additive manufacturing, it presented itself as an ideal candidate for post-processing optimization using methods of machine learning due to its faster print time. 66% of the Multi-jet Fusion production process, from build job preparation and nesting to delivery of finished parts is comprised of its cooling process step. This cooling process step can take anywhere from 3 to 30¬†h, depending on a number of factors. While speeding up cooling does not come into question when processing semi-crystalline polymers, such as polyamides, knowing the necessary cooling time with relatively high accuracy, becomes crucial. In this study, a machine learning model was created to predict a significantly more accurate cooling time using a number of build job parameters. The optimized cooling model was trained using the measured cooling times of varying build jobs as output and build job height, number of layers, packing density, number of parts and room temperature as inputs. The machine learning model predicts significantly more accurate cooling times than the manufacturer predictions. Furthermore, as with all machine learning models, it was shown that an increased number of data, resulted in more accurate predictions. The implementation of the optimized cooling model at BMW‚Äôs AM production facility leads to increased transparency, leaner production and a higher overall economic viability of AM technologies. ¬© 2020, German Academic Society for Production Engineering (WGP)."

The adoption of technologies like Industry 4.0, Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) in critical infrastructures have made it a lucrative target for cyberattackers. Protecting critical infrastructure is of paramount importance due to the sensitive nature of the data coupled with the resource-constrained nature of the devices. The advent of blockchains can be a significant enabler for protecting critical infrastructure through the use of immutable ledger for storing the operations. However, blockchains are computationally expensive, have limited scalability and incur significant delays in processing transactions thus necessitating the development of a lightweight platform while retaining the functionality. This paper develops a lightweight blockchain based framework for protecting critical infrastructure by leveraging its hierarchical nature. Evaluation using embedded devices shows that our proposed framework minimizes the execution time of blockchain operations thus making it suitable for protecting critical infrastructure.

From one side, it has been affected by the fourth industrial revolution (Industry 4.0). From the other side, it has had to enhance its ability to meet higher customer expectations, such as producing more customized products in a shorter time. In the contemporary competitive market of manufacturing, quality is a criterion of primary importance for winning market share. Quality improvement must be coupled with a concern for high performance. One of the most promising concepts for quality control and improvement is called zero defect manufacturing (ZDM), which utilizes the benefits of Industry 4.0 technologies. ZDM imposes the rule that any event in the production process should have a counter-action to mitigate it. In light of this, the current research developed a methodology the manufacturer can use to correctly select or design appropriate ZDM strategies and equipment to implement at each manufacturing stage. This methodology consists of several steps. The first step is to conduct several simulations using a dynamic scheduling tool with specific data sets to develop a digital twin (DT). The data sets are created using the Taguchi design of experiments methodology. The DT model is created for use in predicting the results of the developed scheduling tool without actually using said tool. Using the DT, multiple ZDM parameter-combination sets can be created and plugged into the model. This process generates ZDM performance maps that show the effect of each ZDM strategy at each manufacturing stage under different control parameters. These maps are intended to provide information for comparing different ZDM-oriented equipment to help manufacturers reach a final decision on correct and efficient ZDM implementation or to assist in the design phase of a ZDM strategy implementation. ¬© 2021 The Author(s)"

However, the typical harsh wireless channel conditions found inside industrial environments, together with interferences caused by workers and machinery, constitute a challenge for this kind of system. This paper describes a real industrial problem (location and tracking of forklift trucks) that requires precise internal positioning and presents a study on the feasibility of meeting this challenge using UWB technology. To this end, a simulator of this technology was created based on UWB measurements from a set of real sensors.

The next generation of mobile communications, 5G, will enable better flexibility and service quality through network slicing. Network slicing is a means of creating logically separated use case specific virtual networks over the same physical network. However, there is a lack of techno-economic research related to the management of network slices. Network slice management needs to take into account the multiple network domains, business actors and value networks involved in a vertical such as smart factories. The key for network slices to succeed where other resource reservation and quality of service technologies have previously failed is with well-defined feasible management models and strategies. In this paper, we focus on network slice management, possible strategies and implications for a smart factory. We study a state-of-the-art electronics assembly factory in Finland to find existing need for network slicing and missing capabilities to support smart factory use cases. Next, we define use case specific network slices and develop a network slice management model based on 5G specifications. The model allows for distribution of network functions between business actors over multiple network domains. The value network analysis method is utilized to develop alternative configurations that constitute the network slicing strategies facilitated by the model. Factory managers can decide on the most feasible strategy based on traditional factors such as make or buy, security, and level of automation. The strategies also differ in their technical applicability to different use cases. A feasibility study reveals the strategic differences from factory, local network operator and large mobile network operator perspectives. ¬© 2019 Elsevier B.V."

Moreover, reducing the maintenance, infrastructure and reconfiguration costs, and increasing the flexibility are general goals for communication systems in Industry 4.0. Although some works have extended the Ethernet standard IEEE 802.3 to satisfy the real-time requirements of industrial automation systems, the existing works have one or more of the following drawbacks: poor scalability, insufficient self-configuration capabilities, or increased costs due to their use of proprietary hardware. In this paper, we propose a Time-slotted Software-defined Industrial Ethernet (TS-SDIE) for real-time Quality of Service (QoS) in Industry 4.0. The paper addresses two key technologies of TS-SDIE, time synchronization and time slot-based packet switching. First, we develop a precision time protocol-based link delay compensation mechanism to handle the delay variance in networks. Precise synchronization is achieved at the microsecond level. Second, we design a system architecture for time slot-based industrial switches with four modules responsible for time synchronization, flow classification, time slot assignment, and packet forwarding, respectively. The experimental results show that the switch delay and its jitter can be reduced to 12.2Œºs and 0.12Œºs, respectively, for packets with a size of 100 B, which satisfies the requirements of time-sensitive networking for industrial automation systems. ¬© 2019 Elsevier B.V."

For this reason, both process optimization and minimization of administrative effort are issues of great importance for companies operating gas networks. The present study dealt with the optimization of the abovementioned process (New Customer Gas Connection) regarding a company operating as a natural gas network operator in Greece. For this purpose, interviews were conducted with the company's top management and employees in order to record the current situation (AS-IS) concerning the process. After the implementation of AS-IS analysis, existing process weaknesses were identified and an improved process was designed. At this point, the study introduced Industry 4.0 technologies, which are a developing and hot trend in the last decade, focusing on the use of sensors and actuators in order to automate a series of processes. Industry 4.0 is used mainly in industries, and its methodologies and tools have also been used in the gas industry. During the process reengineering (TO-BE), four Industry 4.0- related domains were identified, in which major improvements could be applied: the use of smart meters in order to measure gas consumption, the use of smart tags in order to manage the maintenance of gas equipment, the use of smart tags in order to control document traceability within the company and the coordination (integration) of the process using appropriate information systems. Based on the above, it is concluded that by using technologies and tools related to Industry 4.0, reorganizing processes and making a sensible investment, long-term savings can be achieved. In addition, the total duration of the process may be significantly reduced. The research effort should be continued by further analyzing more case studies which clarify the role and importance of managing and modeling business processes in conjunction with Industry 4.0, with the final aim of improving processes and performance of companies as a whole. ¬© 2019 ACM."

In Industry 4.0 deployment, production logistics synchronisation (PLS) requires production systems to support synchronised operation among multiple units in the internet of things environment, thereby ensuring the optimal operation of the system. This means that enterprises need to dynamically optimise hardware/ software resource configuration and execution plans for execution units. These all require a lot of capital and technology investment, which ordinary enterprises can hardly afford. Therefore, how to provide low-cost, high-quality flexible resources and synchronised decision support have become the two key challenges in achieving PLS. Then the cloud-based PLS service infrastructure (CPLSS) is proposed. The CPLSS is oriented towards the synchronised operation requirements of customised production systems and adopts an integrated service mode to provide reconfigurable hardware/software resources and synchronised decision support services for the resource service life cycle. A real-life case study of applying CPLSS solution in an air-conditioning industry has been conducted. The implementation results show that the proposed CPLSS solution can reduce operating costs and improve the efficiency of finished product warehousing. ¬© 2020 Institution of Engineering and Technology.

The article proposes a sensor node composed from cone-shaped tool holder for shank-type rotating tools with embedded self-powering wireless data processing and transmission system. Design of the tool holder with helical slots on its surface is prepared and presented. These helical slots introduced on the surface of the cone-shaped tool holder transforms the cutting tool torsional (T) vibrations present during operation into the longitudinal (L) vibrations that propagate through the tool holder in the axial direction and excite the piezoelectric transducer. The purpose of the developed sensor node inside the tool holder is to monitor the heavy lubricated milling process which is expressed by the capacitor load rate of harvested electric charge, which depends on the conditions of the cutting tool. The electric charge generated by exciting of piezoelectric transducer from the cutting tool vibrations exponentially rises until the capacitor is fully charged and the capacitor charging time interval is recorded while the harvested energy is used to power auxiliary electronics with wireless data transmission capability. As the intensity of energy accumulation depends on the state of the cutting tool wear, the capacitor charging time is used to detect changes in the tool condition. Such proposed real-time cutting process monitoring allows controlling the quality of the workpiece being machined and preventing damage to the equipment.

By analyzing the real-Time sensing data, the health status of each machinery is usually monitored to reduce the risk of suddenly machine failure. Although massive sensors allocation can leverage the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) estimation for each machinery, the cost for the sensor network construction will become expensive. Hence, it is necessary to have an approach to remove the redundant sensors under a certain constraint of RUL estimation. On the other hand, due to the attractive performance on the object classification, many researches apply Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to decide which allocated sensor should be removed during the training process. However, the current researches aim to remove the redundant sensors based on the sensing data at a specific time, which lacks the intrinsic feature of time-series sensing data. Therefore, the current researches suffer from the problem of sensor under-killing due to the worst-case consideration. In this paper, we consider the information of time-series sensing data to propose an integrated group-based valuable sensor selection algorithm. Because the proposed approach considers the historical data during the redundant sensor removing process, we can reduce the number of involved allocated sensors precisely and significantly. In order to verify the proposed method, we use the Commercial Modular Aero-Propulsion System Simulation (CMAPSS) dataset and adopt Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) score to evaluate the RUL estimation performance. Compared with the conventional approach, the proposed approach can reduce 86% average PHM score and employ fewer sensors to fit the strict constraint of PHM score with less computing overhead. ¬© 2020 IEEE."

In such a complex and security-critical system with resource-constrained sensor nodes, the design of a secure user authentication scheme for preventing real-time data from unauthorized access is full of challenges, and the main crux lies in how to realize the important property of forward secrecy. Existing schemes either fail to achieve forward secrecy or achieve forward secrecy with high computation cost on sensor nodes. Besides, they often fail to conform to the development trend of industry 4.0 systems where a cloud center is necessary to help intelligent decision-making and alleviate computation and storage pressure. Therefore, in this paper, we propose an efficient privacy-preserving user authentication scheme with forward secrecy for industry 4.0, and formally prove its security in the random oracle model. Compared with previous schemes, it has three advantages: (1) all eleven state-of-the-art criteria are achieved; (2) its computation cost on sensor nodes is comparable to those insecure schemes that employ only symmetric cryptographic algorithms, and is superior to those that also use asymmetric cryptographic algorithms; (3) it takes the advantage of the computation and storage capabilities of the cloud center to achieve user anonymity and the resistance to offline dictionary attack without performing any asymmetric cryptographic algorithms on gateways.

Unfortunately, the diffusion of data-driven predictive maintenance methodologies is limited by (i) the absence of timely ground-truth knowledge (i.e., class labels), required in the learning phase of data-driven supervised approaches, and (ii) the limited availability of data-mining expertise among application-domain experts, required to harness the power of machine learning techniques. Innovative data-driven services are needed to support domain experts in (i) applying powerful self-learning intelligent techniques with limited technical expertise and (ii) easily understanding results and choices operated by such intelligent techniques, to increase trust by means of transparency. To this aim, this paper presents UDaMP, an integrated platform to support manufacturing intelligence by providing a transparent, self-tuning, unsupervised discovery and assisted data labelling service for predictive maintenance, specifically targeted at cyclic industrial processes. UDaMP includes (i) production-cycle-aware feature engineering, (ii) unsupervised discovery of production-cycle categories, (iii) self-tuning of the optimal number of categories, (iv) human-readable characterisation of production-cycle categories, and (v) assisted data labelling for domain experts. Scalable clustering algorithms automatically discover groups of production cycles sharing common time-independent properties. A self-tuning strategy is integrated to automatically configure the specific input parameter and select the best approach for the data under analysis. Each cluster is then locally characterised through the data distribution of the top 10 most relevant features to support domain experts in uncovering its meaning. Experimental evaluation of UDaMP has been performed on real-world data collected in two different industrial settings. ¬© 2021 Elsevier Ltd"

This paper aims to present a generalized methodology for automated material identification using machine vision and machine learning technologies to contribute to the cognitive abilities of machine tools as wells as material handling devices such as robots deployed in industry 4.0.

These color components are used as features while training the machine learning algorithm. Support vector machine is used as a classifier and other classification algorithms such as Decision trees, Random forests, Logistic regression, and k-Nearest Neighbor are also applied to the prepared data set. The capability of the proposed methodology to identify the different group of materials is verified with the images available in an open source database. The methodology presented has been validated by conducting four experiments for checking the classification accuracies of the classifier.

This article presents an Industry 4.0-based composite process modeling pipeline, including both dataset- and model-based knowledge engineering activities pertinent to industrial considerations, with the novel approach of integrating domain expertise directly into the dataset and model building activities. This is investigated through a case study on the autoclave cure process of the Hexcel AS4/8552 carbon prepreg material. In particular, surrogate and highly interpretable models such as Logistic Rule Regression are combined with domain expert knowledge under a fuzzy scoring to provide a tool for assessing the quality (knowledgeability) of complex manufacturing datasets, prior to training black-box models. Further, specificity as a global indicator is combined with the novel Decision Boundary Crispness Score (DBSC) as a local indicator, to better quantify the overall confidence of the users in the model's prediction in the context of small perturbations in manufacturing conditions. Results demonstrate that the DBSC yields a more granular and conservative assessment of both dataset and model quality.

Enabling the interaction of industrial Internet of Things (IOT) platforms with Blockchain might be challenging because standards are still missing in both these technologies. Moreover, integrating productive assets with distributed data exchange and storage technologies is a kind of activity that needs to take into account various aspects, in particular: interoperability, portability, scalability, and security that need to be guaranteed by design. This paper describes the implementation of a portable, platform-agnostic and secure Blockchain Tokenizer for Industrial IOT trustless applications. The Industrial Blockchain Tokenizer (IBT) is based on an industrial data acquisition unit able to gather data from both modern and legacy machines while also interfacing directly with sensors. Acquired data can be processed locally enabling an edge filtering paradigm and then sent to any Blockchain platform. The system has been designed, implemented and then tested on two supply chain scenarios. Tests demonstrated the system capability to act as a bridge between industrial assets and Blockchain platforms enabling the generation of immutable and trust-less ‚Äúdigital twins‚Äù for industrial IOT applications. ¬© 2019 Elsevier B.V."

With it, new concepts such as Industry 4.0 and Logistics 4.0 are arising. Due to the increase in data volume, velocity, and variety, organizations are now looking to their data analytics infrastructures and searching for approaches to improve their decision-making capabilities, in order to enhance their results using new approaches such as Big Data and Machine Learning. The implementation of a Big Data Warehouse can be the first step to improve the organizations‚Äô data analysis infrastructure and start retrieving value from the usage of Big Data technologies. Moving to Big Data technologies can provide several opportunities for organizations, such as the capability of analyzing an enormous quantity of data from different data sources in an efficient way. However, at the same time, different challenges can arise, including data quality, data management, and lack of knowledge within the organization, among others. In this work, we propose an approach that can be adopted in the logistics department of any organization in order to promote the Logistics 4.0 movement, while highlighting the main challenges and opportunities associated with the develop-ment and implementation of a Big Data Warehouse in a real demonstration case at a multinational automotive organization. ¬© 2021 by the authors.

These devices have to be connected via a reliable, low-latency, low-power and low operating-cost network. Although LoRaWAN provides a low-power and reasonable-cost network technology, its current ALOHA-based MAC protocol limits its scalability and reliability. A common practise in wireless networks is to solve this issue and improve scalability through the use of time-slotted communications. However, any time-slotted approach comes with overheads to compute and disseminate the transmission schedule in addition to ensuring global time synchronisation. Affording these overheads is not straight forward with LoRaWAN restrictions on radio duty-cycle and downlink availability. Therefore, in this work, we propose TS-LoRa, an approach that tackles these overheads by allowing devices to self-organise and determine their slot positions in a frame autonomously. In addition to that, only one dedicated slot in each frame is used to ensure global synchronisation and handle acknowledgements. Our experimental results with 25 nodes show that TS-LoRa can achieve more than 99% packet delivery ratio even for the most distant nodes. Moreover, our simulations with a higher number of nodes revealed that TS-LoRa exhibits a lower energy consumption than the confirmable version of LoRaWAN while not compromising the packet delivery ratio. ¬© 2020 The Authors"

In manufacturing, information about human behavior in manual assembly tasks is rare when no interaction with machines is involved. We suggest technologies to automatically detect material picking and placement in the assembly workflow to gather accurate data about human behavior and flexible support of human‚Äìprocess interaction. The detection of material picking is achieved by using background subtraction in combination with scales. For placement detection, two approaches are tested: image classification using convolutional neural networks and object detection using Haar wavelets. The detected fine-grained worker activities are then correlated with a hybrid model of the assembly workflow using the business process model and notation and case management model and notation, enabling the measurement of production time (time per state) and quality (frequency of error) on the shop floor as an entry point for conformance checking and process optimization. The approach has been evaluated in a quantitative case study recording the assembly process 30 times in a laboratory setup within 4 h. Under these conditions, the classification of assembly states using a neural network provides a test accuracy of 99.25% on 38 possible assembly states. Material picking based on background subtraction has been evaluated in an informal user study with six participants performing 16 picks each, providing an accuracy of 99.48%. The suggested method offers a promising approach to easily assess fine-grained timings and error rates of assembly steps which can be used to optimize the corresponding process. ¬© 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature."

The focus of this article is to demonstrate how digital technologies can be used to enable data from production systems to inform decisions and generate value for an organization. This article showcases this with examples from real-world industrial cases, and the technologies used are 3-D laser scanning and 5G communication. The 3-D laser scanning is used to collect spatial data to build a virtual representation of a factory, and 5G is utilized to collect machine data from various data sources, e.g., the machine computer and external sensors. The results show that available data can support multiple roles in the organization and throughout the different phases of a production system. The status of the machine can be monitored in real time, a design can be evaluated against a system's behavior, an organization can learn from the data transformed into information, and the virtual representation provides a very accurate and photorealistic representation of a system as-is. Digital technologies can enable more data representing the system and support the organization in knowing more about their processes when used in the right way.

There are several ways in which the molten electrode droplet can be transferred to the weld pool known as metal transfer modes. Identifying the metal transfer mode automatically is essential to monitor and control the welding process, especially in automated processes employed in modern Industry 4.0 manufacturing lines. However, limited research on this topic has been found in literature. This paper explores the automatic classification of metal transfer modes in GMAW based on machine learning techniques with various signals from the welding process, including acoustics, current, voltage and gas flow rate signals. Time and frequency domain features are first extracted from these signals and are used in a support vector machine classifier to detect the metal transfer modes. A feature selection algorithm is proposed to improve the prediction rate from 80 to 99% when all four signals are utilised. When only the non-intrusive acoustic signal is used, the prediction rates with and without the proposed feature selection algorithm are approximately 96% and 81%, respectively. The high prediction rate demonstrates the feasibility and promising accuracy of the acoustic signal‚Äìbased classification method for future smart welding technology with real-time adaptive feedback control of the welding process. ¬© 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature."

Today, ethernet-based control systems are used all across Industry 4.0, including in critical applications, allowing for straight integration with information technology layers. Even if it is known that current RTE protocols do not have strong authentication or ciphering options, it is still very challenging to perform undetected cyber-attacks to these protocols while the NSC is in operation, in particular because such attacks must comply with very strict and small temporal constraints. In this article, a model-based attack is proposed for service degradation of NCS. The attack is carried out in real-time and it can remain undetected for the entire plant life. The attack can be applied to any RTE protocols and, without loss of generality, a detailed analysis of stealth techniques is provided for a specific real use case based on PROFINET. The experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed attack and its high effectiveness. The article also points out some possible future investigation directions in order to mitigate the attack. ¬© 1982-2012 IEEE."

Traditionally, the use of robots has been limited by safety and, in addition, some manufacturing tasks are too complex to be fully automated. Thus, human-robot collaborative applications, where robots are not isolated, are necessary in order to increase the productivity ensuring the safety of the operators with new perception systems for the robot and new interaction interfaces for the human. Moreover, virtual reality has been extended to the industry in the last years, but most of its applications are not related to robots. In this context, this paper works on the synergies between virtual reality and robotics, presenting the use of commercial gaming technologies to create a totally immersive environment based on virtual reality. This environment includes an interface connected to the robot controller, where the necessary mathematical models have been implemented for the control of the virtual robot. The proposed system can be used for training, simulation, and what is more innovative, for robot controlling in an integrated, non-expensive and unique application. Results show that the immersive experience increments the efficiency of the training and simulation processes, offering a cost-effective solution. ¬© 2019 Elsevier B.V."

While the size of a company is becoming less essential, the ability to adapt quickly to changing market conditions and new technologies is more important than ever. This trend particularly applies to the companies' software landscapes, where individual sub-processes and services must be orchestrated, seamlessly integrated, and iteratively renewed according to the ever-increasing user requirements. However, inflexible, closed monolithic software applications as well as self-programmed stand-alone tools that are difficult to integrate are still predominant in the engineering domain. A complete reimplementation of existing, proprietary engineering tools and their integration into monolithic applications of large software providers is often not economically feasible, especially for small and medium-sized machinery and plant manufacturers. In this context, the so-called Process-Driven Approach (PDA) offers a sustainable and tool-neutral opportunity for process and tool orchestration, enabling an easy integration of individual software applications by consistent utilization of the separation of concerns principle. The PDA, originating from business informatics, is mainly based on the standardized and machine-executable visual modeling language Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN). Using the semantic enhancements found in version 2.0, BPMN is not just used to model the business processes but also to model and execute the integration processes between different systems. After the PDA has already been successfully applied to large-scale projects in business informatics, it is now being transferred to the engineering domain. As shown in this paper, PDA allows to orchestrate the different processes in engineering and to integrate the underlying software tools, such as e-mail or spreadsheet applications, engineering tools, or custom microservices, using standardized interfaces like REST API. In doing so, engineering processes can be made more transparent, monitored, and optimized by means of appropriate key figures. The concept is validated by a prototypical implementation of a minimum functional PDA architecture for the engineering domain. ¬© 2020 Elsevier B.V.. All rights reserved."

Against this background, this paper discusses the state of the art condition monitoring and proposes a framework of fault detection and decision making at different levels namely component and station. The introduced framework relies on Virtual Engineering (VE) and Discrete Event Simulation (DES) in smart manufacturing environments.

However, using current information and communications technology (ICT), it is difficult to optimally provide services that require high computing power and low latency. To meet these requirements, mobile-edge computing is emerging as a ubiquitous computing paradigm that enables the use of network infrastructure components such as cluster heads/sink nodes in IIoT and cellular network base stations to provide local data storage and computation servers at the edge of the network. However, optimal location selection for edge servers within a network out of a very large number of possibilities, such as to balance workload and minimize access delay, is a challenging problem. In this article, the edge server placement problem is addressed within an existing network infrastructure obtained from Shanghai Telecom's base station data set that includes a significant amount of call data records and locations of actual base stations. The problem of edge server placement is formulated as a multiobjective constraint optimization problem that places edge servers strategically to balance between the workloads of edge servers and reduce access delay between the industrial control center/cellular base stations and edge servers. To search randomly through a large number of possible solutions and selecting those that are most descriptive of optimal solution can be a very time-consuming process, therefore, we apply the genetic algorithm and local search algorithms (hill climbing and simulated annealing) to find the best solution in the least number of solution space explorations. Experimental results are obtained to compare the performance of the genetic algorithm against the above-mentioned local search algorithms. The results show that the genetic algorithm can quickly search through the large solution space as compared to local search optimization algorithms to find an edge placement strategy that minimizes the cost function. ¬© 2014 IEEE."

Due to increasingly variable products with small quantities and the resulting high degree of adaptability of a plant over its entire operating phase, the need for rapid production commissioning gives rise to the demand for live commissioning support and technology evaluation of induced production start-ups. Classification axioms can be formed by 1-class learning procedures for the predictive state evaluation of subsequent production start-ups based on collected machine and process data from past production start-ups. The starting point is an adaptive algorithm that performs a dynamic tolerance band formation based on different criteria, emphasizing on adaptive characteristic segmentation. This first step represents comprehensive condition monitoring. Based on this algorithm, correlation considerations can be performed on the data structure, the measured variables, and the diagnostic parameters. Moreover, the structure of production systems can and should be included in the analyzation, so that probabilistic causalities can be postulated and then be added to the underlying data sets for quantification. Using these adaptive structure-based segmentations is the first step to interpret data sets of new production systems without the need for complex pre-configuration. ¬© 2020, Editorial Institution of Wrocaw Board of Scientific.

Based on the analysis of the electrocardiogram (ECG) principle of intelligent manufacturing equipment, this paper profoundly studies the key technologies of the Real-time Visualization System (RVS) of intelligent manufacturing equipment operating state. Firstly, the operating state of intelligent manufacturing equipment is the standard to determine the health condition of the equipment, so we define the tolerance value to make real-time judgment on the operating state of the equipment. Secondly, aiming at the outliers in the original data, an improved Rheinda criterion is proposed to eliminate the gross errors in the data. Thirdly, the Baseline value of the intelligent manufacturing equipment operation is the premise of judging the equipment running condition. The correlation analysis is carried out on the processed data, the Baseline model is established and the model robustness is tested. Finally, the robot of vehicle side welding line is taken as an application case to verify the reliability and effectiveness of the system, which provides a new method for monitoring the real-time fine-grained operation and active operation and maintenance of intelligent manufacturing equipment. ¬© 2020 Taiwan Academic Network Management Committee.

Industry 4.0 and IoT technologies facilitate the acquisition of ubiquitous data from machine tools and processes. However, these technologies also lead to the generation of a large number of data that are complex to be analyzed. Due to the streaming nature of the IoT systems, however, stream analytics could be used to extract features as the data are generated and published, which can prevent the need to store the data and perform advanced analytics that require high performance computing. This manuscript aims at demonstrating how traditional historical methods can be modified to be used as stream analytics tools for IoT data streams. Since data analytics is a wide domain, this paper has only focused on the two light-weighted methods that have been popular in the industry: Statistical Process Control Chart (SPCC), and Bayesian classification. This paper has defined, tested, and evaluated the accuracy and latency of the novel variation of these methods. It is concluded that by modifying the traditional methods and defining incremental solutions, methods such as Real-Time Dynamic Statistical Process Control Chart (RTDSPCC) and Incremental Gaussian Na√Øve Bayes (IGNB) can be formed that are highly beneficial for IoT applications as they are highly scalable, require minimal storage, and can update the models in real-time. ¬© 2020 The Authors.

Despite the unparalleled advantages that ML offers, critical limiting factors have prevented the exhaustive cultivation of ML in advanced manufacturing. Constant shifts in the process configuration and lack of sufficient fully-descriptive data restrict the performance of predictive ML models. This paper proposes to partly address these shortfalls with an active transfer learning (ATL) model that is applied to an aerospace composites manufacturing case study. The proposed ATL framework requires 1) developing an AI-based optimal experimental design using Active Learning (AL) to maximize the information gain from the limited number of allowable manufacturing trials, and 2) equipping the manufacturing process with a robust Transfer Learning (TL) model that is trained on limited available data and is immune to shifts in the process settings. The results suggest that uncertainty-based AL approaches can significantly decrease the dependency on large datasets for obtaining accurate process models.

Industry 4.0 and Cloud manufacturing (CMfg), accompanied by a service-oriented architecture model, have been regarded as renowned approaches to enable and facilitate the transition of conventional manufacturing business models into more efficient and productive ones. Furthermore, there is an aptness among the manufacturing and logistics businesses as service providers to synergize and cut down the investment and operational costs via sharing logistics fleet and production facilities in the form of outsourcing and consequently increase their profitability. Therefore, due to the Everything as a Service (XaaS) paradigm, efficient service composition is known to be a remarkable issue in the cloud manufacturing paradigm. This issue is challenging due to the service composition problem's large size and complicated computational characteristics. This paper has focused on the considerable number of continually received service requests, which must be prioritized and handled in the minimum possible time while fulfilling the Quality of Service (QoS) parameters. Considering the NP-hard nature and dynamicity of the allocation problem in the Cloud composition problem, heuristic and metaheuristic solving approaches are strongly preferred to obtain optimal or nearly optimal solutions. This study has presented an innovative, time-efficient approach for mutual manufacturing and logistical service composition with the QoS considerations. The method presented in this paper is highly competent in solving large-scale service composition problems time-efficiently while satisfying the optimality gap. A sample dataset has been synthesized to evaluate the outcomes of the developed model compared to earlier research studies. The results show the proposed algorithm can be applied to fulfill the dynamic behavior of manufacturing and logistics service composition due to its efficiency in solving time. The paper has embedded the relation of task and logistic services for cloud service composition in solving algorithm and enhanced the efficiency of resulted matched services. Moreover, considering the possibility of arrival of new services and demands into cloud, the proposed algorithm adapts the service composition algorithm. ¬© 2021 Sadeghi Aghili et al.

With the advancement of various AI and machine learning technologies the evolution toward improved decision making as well as data-driven intelligent manufacturing has already been evident. However, several emerging issues, including the poisoning attacks, performance, and inadequate data resources, etc., have to be resolved. Recent research works studied the problem lightly, which often leads to unreliable performance, inefficiency, and privacy leakage. In this article, we developed a decentralized paradigm for big data-driven cognitive computing (D2C), using federated learning and blockchain jointly. Federated learning can solve the problem of 'data island' with privacy protection and efficient processing while blockchain provides incentive mechanism, fully decentralized fashion, and robust against poisoning attacks. Using blockchain-enabled federated learning help quick convergence with advanced verifications and member selections. Extensive evaluation and assessment findings demonstrate D2C's effectiveness relative to existing leading designs and models. ¬© 2005-2012 IEEE."

The goal is to design the system upfront in such a way, that it is not perceived as a threat to the worker or his/her job. Within the responsible research and innovation approach, the introduction of new technology needs to be accompanied by a careful investigation of the thoughts and feelings of all stakeholders. Especially workers who are currently not working with robots but their workspace is currently undergoing an Industry 4.0 driven transformation, experience fear, that this new technology will make their jobs redundant. On the other hand, it can be observed, that successful robot interaction processes, on the one hand, increase the overall productivity, but also can enhance human well-being. The feeling of 'teamwork' with the artificial intelligence entity can develop to be equally positive and motivating. To be able to design future workspaces which will result in a 'teamwork' perception instead of the 'fear' perception, the use of VR can be applied. ¬© 2020 IEEE."

Blind Source Separation (BSS) is one of the key technologies which can obtain the desired high-value information from all of the observed raw sensory data. As shown by recent studies, BSS can be both fast enough for low-latency requirements and sufficiently accurate to be a reliable method in large IoT deployments. Nonetheless, the trade-off between signal context usage and data recovery accuracy often affects the separation quality of BSS. In this paper, we propose for the first time a novel dual path convolutional neural network model, called Y-Net, for high accuracy BSS. Specifically, the separation quality is improved by the parallel perception and joint combination of both high-and low-level features of input signals, which we demonstrated through extensive numerical evaluations. In particular, Y-Net improves the Source-to-Distortion Ratio by 2.70% to 35.32% for different target signals, while the model size is only slightly increased, compared to other current solutions. ¬© 2020 IEEE."

The automotive industry, where a transition from combustion to electrically powered vehicles is currently underway, is also concerned with this change. In addition to increasing the capacity of the battery, improving the efficiency of the electric motor is essential. To achieve these goals, however, new technologies such as hairpins for the stator are needed. An important process step involves the welding of two pairs of hairpins, which often leads to welding defects. Nevertheless, expert knowledge in this field is limited. Optical monitoring of the welding process with the help of a convolutional neural network (CNN) is a good approach. This approach can compensate for the low level of expert knowledge and detects and classifies welding defects directly in the production line. However, the disadvantage of optical monitoring is that production conditions and the surrounding environment change over time. This has an impact on optical detection and can negatively affect the accuracy of a CNN. For example, the camera perspective can change, which has a negative effect on optical quality monitoring. Therefore, this paper presents an approach for monitoring and evaluating the quality of a CNN in a cloud instance online. If a deteriorating quality is detected, the CNN in the cloud is re-trained by continuously collected data and then automatically deployed to the production line. This allows the CNN to adapt to the changing environmental conditions. The present approach is demonstrated and validated with real data of the stator production process. Compared with the current state-of-the-art, this control loop is highly automated and requires a minimum of human intervention. ¬© 2020 IEEE."

What makes a smart manufacturing enterprise as opposed to a traditional one is the ability to solve existing problems and predict issues to fix them before they occur while creating advantaged value. Dashboards, assisting decision-makers in business markets, can organize data from machines, sensors, and workers into a real-time visual representation. They provide a quick overview of how your entire business is operating and where you stand in relation to the key performance indicators for supporting the development toward more resource-efficient and sustainable processes. However, if users need more information related to the indicators shown on the dashboard, current approaches mainly rely on human effort to search and retrieve the information. The lack of interaction between the dashboard and users often results in inconvenient operations and limits the usage of the tool, especially in the manufacturing industry. In this study, an interaction design is developed to resolve the issue. The proposed dashboard is developed by a three-layer structure including data layer, processing layer, and presentation layer. A virtual assistant is introduced to play the role of a mediator between the dashboard and the user. It provides users with a natural language interface to communicate, directly interacts with the dashboard on users' behalf, and actively reminds relevant personnel to expedite data collection.

In IIoT, the information communication technologies enabled by IoT could greatly improve the efficiency and timeliness of information exchanges between both vertical and horizontal system integrations. Likewise, machine learning algorithms, particularly Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), are viable for assisting in automated control of complex IIoT systems, with the support of distributed edge computing infrastructure. Despite noticeable performance improvements, the security threats brought by massive interconnections in IoT and the vulnerabilities of deep neural networks used in DRL must be thoroughly investigated and mitigated before widespread deployment. Thus, in this paper we first design a DRL-based controller that could be deployed at edge computing server to enable automated control in an IIoT context. We then investigate malicious behaviors of adversaries with two attacks: (i) function-based attacks that can be launched during training phase and (ii) performance-based attacks that can be launched after training phase, to study the security impacts of vulnerable DRL-based controllers. From the adversary's perspective, maximum entropy Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) is used to approximate a reward function through observation of system trajectories under the control of trained DRL-based controllers. The approximated reward function is then used to launch attacks by the adversary against the Deep Q Network (DQN)-based controller. Via simulation, we evaluate the impacts of our two investigated attacks, finding that attacks are increasingly successful with increasing accuracy of the control model. Furthermore, we discuss some tradeoffs between control performance and security performance of DRL-based IIoT controllers, and outline several future research directions to secure machine learning use in IIoT systems. ¬© 2020 Elsevier B.V."

Therefore, they cannot replace industrial technologies and devices that have performed well over decades 'out of the box'.

Designing a data delivery scheme in the future IIoT networks is undoubtedly a challenging task, as it should satisfy several conflicting requirements: massive-scale, data-intensive, and mission-critical, the requirements of which have motivated the desired need for feasible IIoT network architecture. In particular, the traffic characteristics of certain IIoT applications feature small-data patterns especially in typical automation control scenarios such as robot control on the downlink. In order to reduce the huge overhead associated with each individual unicast transmission of the small-data message, we propose a novel 'multipoint-to-multipoint' and/or 'point-to-multipoint with different contents' communication paradigm-Uni-Multi-Unicast (UMUcast), which is based-on traditional 4G technologies such as evolved Multimedia Broadcast Multicast Service (eMBMS) and Group Communication System Enablers (GCSE), and novel 5G technologies such as Multi-Access Edge Computing (MEC). For the downlink, the UMUcast transmitter can jointly encode multiple-sources' small-data messages into a single chunk at MEC equipment in conjoint with a gNB, where chunk can be one-off transmission to multiple receivers simultaneously through an eMBMS frame, whereas the chunk is decoded into multiple small-data by each individual IIoT devices separately and respectively. The simulation results show that UMUcast has remarkable improvements over conventional point-to-point unicasting in handling multi-source, multi-destination, and massive small-data delivery with characteristics of low-overhead, high-throughput, and ultra-low-latency for future 5G-based IIoT networks. ¬© 1983-2012 IEEE."

It incorporates secure networks, secure control systems, secure physical processes, and their interactions seamlessly into a unified framework. To increase the resistance of ICSs against intrusions, the network security in our architectural approach is to secure the data in motion through the integration of secure network architecture, secure industrial network protocols, and secure end-to-end communications. The protection of control systems in our architectural approach is risk-based and hierarchical and encompasses prevention- and tolerance-centric defenses. It provides a layer-by-layer defense so that an acceptable level of cybersecurity risk is achieved and maintained. Aiming to maintain the stable operation of physical ICS processes, the secure control in our architectural approach implements a security process against process-aware attacks through a resilient safety control scheme.

Data captured through the KPIs monitoring tool were collected in a knowledge repository, and were processed using a Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) technique, estimating the required maintenance time. A validation of the proposed methodology was performed based on real-life data from a mold-making European Small Medium Enterprise (SME).

These concepts often paint an interesting vision of what future industrial production, and society at large, could be. It is, however, difficult to look past the jargon and pinpoint exactly how these concepts contribute in the daily lives of sulfuric acid plant operators, as well as to grasp how these bold visions are to be implemented. Acid plant operators juggle multiple issues trying to keep their plants running efficiently and reliably, and additional data often only causes information overload, rather than making it easier to make decisions. With the revolutionary ClearView‚Ñ¢ process health monitoring solution, as well the DynSOx‚Ñ¢ software for simulating dynamic operation, Haldor Topsoe strives to bring digital services with real and tangible operational benefits to the sulfuric acid industry. With ClearView‚Ñ¢, Topsoe uses key knowledge and expertise as a technology licensor, a catalyst supplier, and a technical service provider to deliver a cloud-based connected services solution for process health monitoring. It goes without saying that reliable and consistent operation is of utmost importance; ClearView‚Ñ¢ has been designed with early event detection of process-related incidents in mind in order to target and prevent unplanned downtime. ClearViewTM combines Topsoe's decades of experience into a readily-available package that will complement, not replace, technical interactions between Topsoe and its customers. DynSOx‚Ñ¢ further helps complete the jigsaw puzzle by offering insight into the behavior of the plant during unsteady state operation, start-up and shutdown scenarios. Operation during unsteady state is very different from that at steady state, and understanding the behavior of the plant during these conditions better means that downtime and suboptimal plant performance can be avoided. Together, ClearView‚Ñ¢ and DynSOx‚Ñ¢ will help acid plant operators meet their targets, every day. ¬© 2019Sulphur 2019 + Sulphuric Acid. All rights reserved."
